# About

The purpose of this repository is to do some exploratory data analysis on the [MIMIC-III Clinical Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii-demo/1.4/). Since the [actual data](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) requires the following:

1. Credentialed access 
2. Completion of required training 
3. Signing a data use agreement form

The demo version of the data set was chosen. It has a smaller amount of data, but large enough to create some visualizations from it. It's also open access and shares the same schema as the credentialed data.

The tech stack that's emphasized for this project is DuckDB (SQL) and Power BI for visualization. Python is also used but only to execute the SQL scripts in a sequential manner.
